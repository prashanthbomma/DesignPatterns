# Design Patterns
This repo contains all design patterns as suggested by GoF

1. Memento Pattern -
   The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback). The memento pattern is   implemented with three objects: the originator, a caretaker and a memento.

2. State Pattern -
   The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   
3. Iterator Pattern -
   The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.

4. Strategy Pattern -
   The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
